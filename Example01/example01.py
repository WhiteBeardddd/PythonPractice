#Create a simple CRUD program in Python for managing a list of students, where each student has the following attributes:
#Name
#Age
#Grade
#Tasks:
#Create: Add a new student to the list.
#Read: View all students in the list.
#Update: Edit a student's information.
#Delete: Remove a student from the list.
#Try implementing this with a menu-driven interface, where the user can choose options like 1. Add Student, 2. View Students, 3. Update Student, 4. Delete Student, and 5. Exit.#

name = input("input name: ")
age = int(input("input age: "))
grade = int(input("input grade: "))
